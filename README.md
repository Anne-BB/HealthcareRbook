#Applications of R in Healthcare 

This is book based on **R Markdown** and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

A copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format can be generated by typing in Rstudio `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. 

The references are kept in the book.bib file. They are generated from TeXMed - a BibTeX interface for PubMed at https://www.bioinformatics.org/texmed/.

The files were uploaded to github using git bash

```git
#removing files from github
git  git rm --cached 04-application.Rmd
git commit -m "remove old 04-application.Rmd"
git push origin master

#adding files to github
git add *.Rmd
git commit -m "updating bookdown with new chapters and data"
git push origin master
```
